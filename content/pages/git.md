Hello! My name is Tomas, and I work with Python everyday.

Today I want to write about linters and formatters. ðŸŽ‰ 
Iâ€™ve been studying this topic for the past eight months and continue to do so. Iâ€™m writing this in the hope of helping at least one person.

What is a linter? What is a formatter?
Linter and formatters are tools that assist us in writing better code.
These tools automatically changes and rewrite (if you choose) your code according to a set of rules or styles guides.

This help us analyze and check our code for syntax errors, potential bugs, code smells and other issues.
To a better understanding, we can summarize:
Lint â†’ analyzes how the code runs and detect errors or bugs.
Formatter â†’ restructures how the code appears.

Here is a brief explanation about linters and formatters. I encourage you to explore and apply them to write better code following best practices. Remember, you can use linters and formatters regardless of the programming language you use. ðŸ˜„ 

Thank you a lot for take your time and read this. See you in a next article ðŸ™‚
